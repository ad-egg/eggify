				<p>
				When you have any non-egg (eggn't) content to share with a "only allowed to say egg" community, like a funny story or joke, sharing it just as it is will result in you getting removed from the community! That is where <STRONG>eggify</STRONG> swoops in to save the day, by helping you turn all of your words into "egg"! Now your story or joke or whatever is safe to share. A link is also provided, for friends who are in these communities but do not speak fluent egg, to view the original input. As a bonus, any digit in your input is replaced by "0" to make the output more egg-like.
