# eggify
This project is a collaboration between Samie Azad and Athena Deng for their portfolio project at the end of their foundation year at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/). It was designed to be the ultimate portfolio project: 
Athena using Django framework to build the backend web application, MySQL to store client data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend; 
and Samie deploying the web application in containers, using Kubernetes to manage the clusters, Puppet manifests to configure the containers, and PHP.

## what eggify does
When you have any non-egg (eggn't) content to share with a "only allowed to say egg" community, like a funny story or joke, sharing it just as it is will result in you getting removed from the community! That is where eggify swoops in to save the day, by helping you turn all of your words into "egg"! Now your story or joke or whatever is safe to share. A link is also provided, for friends who are in these communities but do not speak fluent egg, to view the original input. As a bonus, any digit in the input is replaced by "0" to make the output more egg-like.

## to deploy
* You must create an empty directory after cloning named `mysql`
